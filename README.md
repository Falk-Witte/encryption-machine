# encryption-machine
A encryption machine for encrypting text. Nothing fancy

The password for encryption-machine.py is a comment in database.py.
You can change it, just by encrypting a different word with the pbkdf2_sha256 algorithm and changing the string in database.py.


You can add all kinds of features if you want, i try to check every pr.
